# WIP: A 2D Engine, and Pacman example
### This is a simple 2D rendering engine for making 2D games or simulations

This project was inspired, derived and modified from the wonderful work of Majoolwip
* https://github.com/Majoolwip/PixEngine
* Author: Ryan Moore - Initial Work

This project consists of a modular 2d rendering engine, and an example Pacman game.
The engine can be imported and has rewriteable functions for `updating` and `rendering`.
